# Round Carplay

Round Caraplay is an attempt to adapt the classic Apple CarPlay to a round screen using a Raspberry Pi. The idea is to display CarPlay in a central square area and then fill the surrounding space with information coming from the vehicle’s OBD bus.

Support for Linux (ARM/x86) and macOS (ARM) as well. It is a standalone Electron app, optimized for embedded setups and ultra-low-resolution OEM displays.  

> **Requirements:** A Carlinkit **CPC200-CCPA** (wireless & wired) or **CPC200-CCPW** (wired only) adapter.

## Wi-Fi backup camera

The right-side crescent button opens the integrated JieLi AC792x/CC31 Wi-Fi
backup camera. Double-tap the button to open or close the feed. The host running
Round CarPlay must be connected to the camera's `W-Car...` Wi-Fi network; the
application controls `192.168.1.1:3333` and receives MJPEG on UDP port `2224`.
The Settings screen can rotate the Wi-Fi feed continuously from `0°` through
`359°` in one-degree steps; the selection is saved across restarts.
For visual calibration, tap the adjustment button at the top center of the live
feed, move the slider, then tap the same button again to save and dismiss it.

The Camera tab continues to support ordinary USB cameras through the browser
media-device API. The standalone low-latency SDL diagnostic viewer remains in
[`wifi_cam`](wifi_cam/README.md).

## GPS speedometer

Tap the car artwork below the CarPlay square to switch between the artwork and
a live MPH readout. On Raspberry Pi, the app reads 9600-baud NMEA from
`/dev/serial0`; the serial hardware must be enabled and the serial login shell
disabled. The display shows `-- MPH` until the receiver has a valid GPS fix.

## On-display system menu

The menu button in the upper surround opens a panel over the CarPlay square;
CarPlay remains mounted and reappears immediately when the panel closes. The
panel can change the surround color, scan and connect to NetworkManager Wi-Fi
networks, and display the Pi's active IPv4 addresses. Raspberry Pi OS Bookworm
and newer use NetworkManager by default.

## Installation (Raspberry Pi OS)

```bash
curl -LO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OneMakerShow/round-carplay/main/setup-pi.sh
sudo chmod +x setup-pi.sh
./setup-pi.sh
```

The `setup-pi.sh` script performs the following tasks:

1. check for required tools: curl and xdg-user-dir
2. configures udev rules to ensure the proper access rights for the CarPlay dongle
3. downloads the latest AppImage
4. creates an autostart entry, so the application will launch automatically on boot
5. creates a desktop shortcut for easy access to the application

*Do not run this script on other Linux distributions.*

### System Requirements (build)

Make sure the following packages and tools are installed on your system before building:

- **Python 3.x** (for native module builds via `node-gyp`)
- **build-essential** (Linux: includes `gcc`, `g++`, `make`, etc.)
- **libusb-1.0-0-dev** (required for `node-usb`)
- **libudev-dev** (optional but recommended for USB detection on Linux)
- **fuse** (required to run AppImages)

### Clone & Build

```bash
git clone --branch main --single-branch https://github.com/OneMakerShow/round-carplay.git \
  && cd pi-carplay \
  && npm run install:clean \
  && npm run build \
  && npm run build:armLinux
```

---

### Linux (x86_64)

This AppImage has been tested on Debian Trixie (13). No additional software is required — just download the x86_64.AppImage and make it executable.

```bash
chmod +x round-carplay-*-x86_64.AppImage
```

---

### Mac (arm64)

This step is required for all non-Apple-signed apps.

```bash
xattr -cr /Applications/round-carplay.app
```

For microphone support, please install Sound eXchange (SoX) via brew.
```bash
brew install sox
```
